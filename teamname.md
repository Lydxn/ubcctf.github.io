title: Team Name | CTF @ UBC
---


Our original team name was **UBCCTF**. We decided that was too boring and eventually arrived at the current name, **Maple Bacon**: based off of the maple leaf of the Canadian flag and the bacon on the UBC crest.

(Some may tell you those are waves. Don't listen to them. It's definitely bacon.)
