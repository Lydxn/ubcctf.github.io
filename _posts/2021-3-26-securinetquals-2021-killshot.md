# kill_shot

## Mitigations

```
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Full RELRO
    Stack:    Canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      PIE enabled
```

## Setup

The setup of the problem is as follow:

1. A function that provides a `printf()` leak.
2. A function called `kill()` that lets you write eight bytes to anywhere. Only called once.
3. A while loop that allows you to call `malloc()` and `free()` as many times as you want.

Our initial approach was to use our arbritray write in order to overwrite the return address with a one gadget.
However, the binary only allows certain syscalls via a seccomp filter.
Namely, `read`, `write`, `fstat`, `mprotect`, and `openat` are the only syscalls allowed.


## Approach

TLDR:
1. Leak addresses
2. Overwrite `__free_hook`
3. ROP with `mprotect` and `read`
4. Send shellcode
5. Return to shellcode
6. ???
7. Profit

Using the format specifier bug we can leak three addresses.
A stack address, a binary address, and a libc address.
We will see why this is useful later.

After the one gadget didn't work we tried  using `kill()` to write a stack address so that we could free it later in order make `malloc` return an address that was on the stack.
We spent quite a bit of time on this approach before Fillip told us about `__free_hook`.
A quick explanation of `__free_hook` is that it is a libc constant that is used whenever `free()` is called and if `__free_hook` is set to another function then it will call that function instead of `free()`.
Since we have a libc leak we can use `kill()` to write the address of `kill()` to `__free_hook`.
Then since we can call `free()` as many times as we want then we can write to anywhere we want as many times as we want.  

Now our ROP chain will consist of calling `mprotect` in order to get an rwx page somewhere in the binary then calling `read` in order to send shellcode.
Finally, return to where the shellcode is.

Our shellcode will call `read` so we can give it the path of the flag which is `/home/ctf/flag.txt`.
Then we will use that path in order to open the flag file using `openat` and use `read` again in order to read the contents of the flag.
Finally, use `write` in order to print the contents of the flag.
